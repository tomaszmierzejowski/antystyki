## ⚠️ Critical Issues to Fix (Before Launch)

### 🔴 SECURITY - Must Fix Immediately

1. **Hardcoded Password in Git**
   - File: `backend/Antystics.Api/appsettings.json`
   - Line 3: `Password=Quake112`
   - **Fix**: Remove from file, use environment variables
   - **Time**: 5 minutes

2. **Weak JWT Secret**
   - Current: `your-super-secret-key-change-this-in-production-min-32-chars-long`
   - **Fix**: Generate random 64-character string
   - **Time**: 2 minutes

3. **HTTPS Not Enforced**
   - File: `backend/Antystics.Api/Program.cs`
   - Line 77: `RequireHttpsMetadata = false`
   - **Fix**: Set to `true` for production
   - **Time**: 1 minute

4. **Missing Environment Files**
   - No `.env` files for production
   - **Fix**: Create `.env` files from templates
   - **Time**: 10 minutes

5. **Missing CAPTCHA**
   - Registration endpoint unprotected
   - **Fix**: Implement reCAPTCHA v3
   - **Time**: 45 minutes

### 🟡 HIGH PRIORITY - Fix Before Launch

6. **Email Service Not Configured**
   - Placeholder credentials in config
   - **Fix**: Set up Gmail App Password or SendGrid
   - **Time**: 15 minutes

7. **No Rate Limiting**
   - API can be spammed
   - **Fix**: Add rate limiting middleware
   - **Time**: 30 minutes

8. **CORS Only Allows Localhost**
   - Production domain not whitelisted
   - **Fix**: Update CORS configuration
   - **Time**: 5 minutes

9. **Missing Security Headers**
   - No X-Frame-Options, CSP, etc.
   - **Fix**: Add security headers middleware
   - **Time**: 5 minutes

10. **No Monitoring**
    - No health checks or uptime monitoring
    - **Fix**: Add /health endpoint + UptimeRobot
    - **Time**: 20 minutes

## ⚠️ Known Limitations (Current MVP)

These are acceptable for MVP but should be addressed later:

1. **No CAPTCHA** (being added) - Bot protection needed
2. **No rate limiting** - Can be abused
3. **Basic error messages** - Could be more user-friendly
4. **No analytics** - Can't track user behavior
5. **No A/B testing** - Can't optimize conversion
6. **Single language** - Only Polish currently active
7. **No caching** - Performance could be better
8. **No CDN** - Images served from server
9. **Basic moderation** - Could use automated pre-screening
10. **No mobile app** - Web only for now

**All acceptable for MVP! Ship first, iterate later.**

   - Get real user feedback ASAP
   - Fix issues as they come up

2. **Monitor everything**
   - Set up alerts
   - Check logs daily
   - Respond to users quickly

3. **Build in public**
   - Share progress on social media
   - Engage with early users
   - Be transparent about issues

4. **Start small**
   - Invite friends first
   - Grow gradually
   - Scale infrastructure as needed

5. **Stay secure**

---

## 🆘 Emergency Contacts

**If something breaks in production:**

1. **Check logs**: `docker-compose logs -f`

4. **Rollback if needed**: Restore from backup
5. **Contact support**: Open GitHub issue

**Critical Issues?**
- Database down → Restore from backup
