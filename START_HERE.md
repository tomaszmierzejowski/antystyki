## 🎯 Three Paths Forward

Choose based on your timeline:

### Option 1: "I Need It Live TODAY" (8 hours)
**Minimum viable launch - just the essentials**

1. Read `QUICK_MVP_ACTIONS.md` (30 min to fix critical issues)
2. Skip CAPTCHA for now (add it week 1)
3. Deploy to server (4 hours following `PRODUCTION_SETUP.md`)
4. Create basic Privacy Policy (2 hours)
5. Test and launch! (1.5 hours)

**Risk**: Bot spam until CAPTCHA added  
**Reward**: Live today, real user feedback

### Option 2: "Launch This Week" (3 days - RECOMMENDED)
**Safe, professional launch with all critical features**

- **Day 1** (4h): Security fixes + CAPTCHA implementation
- **Day 2** (4h): Server setup + deployment + SSL
- **Day 3** (4h): Testing + legal pages + launch

**Risk**: Minimal  
**Reward**: Professional MVP you can be proud of

### Option 3: "Do It Right" (1 week)
**Everything perfect, including nice-to-haves**

Follow the full `MVP_PRODUCTION_CHECKLIST.md` with:
- All security features
- Rate limiting
- Monitoring & alerts
- Professional legal pages
- Comprehensive testing
- Buffer for unexpected issues

**Risk**: None  
**Reward**: Production-grade launch

## ⚡ The 30-Minute Security Sprint (DO THIS NOW)

Before anything else, fix these critical security issues:

### Issue 1: Exposed Password (5 min)
**File**: `backend/Antystics.Api/appsettings.json`

**Current** (BAD - password visible in git):
```json
"DefaultConnection": "Host=localhost;Port=5432;Database=antystics;Username=postgres;Password=Quake112"
```

**Fix**:
```json
"DefaultConnection": "Host=localhost;Port=5432;Database=antystics;Username=postgres;Password=postgres"
```

Then create `.env` file for production secrets.

### Issue 2: Weak JWT Secret (5 min)

**Generate strong secret**:
```bash
openssl rand -base64 48
```

Copy output, save for `.env` files.

### Issue 3: Create Environment Files (10 min)

**Root `.env`**:
```bash
cat > .env << 'EOF'
POSTGRES_DB=antystics
POSTGRES_USER=postgres
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=YOUR_STRONG_PASSWORD_HERE

JWT_SECRET=YOUR_RANDOM_64_CHAR_SECRET_HERE
JWT_ISSUER=Antystics
JWT_AUDIENCE=AntysticsUsers

SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your-email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=your-app-password
EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=noreply@antystyki.pl
EMAIL_FROM_NAME=Antystyki

VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
EOF
```

**Frontend `.env`**:
```bash
cat > frontend/.env << 'EOF'
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
EOF
```

### Issue 4: Enable HTTPS (5 min)

**File**: `backend/Antystics.Api/Program.cs`

Line 77, change from:
```csharp
options.RequireHttpsMetadata = false;
```

To:
```csharp
options.RequireHttpsMetadata = true; // SECURITY: Require HTTPS
```

### Issue 5: Update CORS (5 min)

**File**: `backend/Antystics.Api/Program.cs`

Lines 104-110, add production domain:
```csharp
policy.WithOrigins(
    "http://localhost:5173", 
    "http://localhost:3000",
    "https://antystyki.pl",
    "https://www.antystyki.pl"
)
```

**✅ Done! You've addressed the most critical security issues.**

## 📧 Email Setup (15 Minutes)

### Gmail Option (Quick & Easy)

1. **Enable 2FA** on your Gmail account
2. **Generate App Password**:
   - Visit: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
   - App: "Mail", Device: "Other (Antystics)"
   - Copy 16-character password

3. **Update `.env`**:
   ```
   SMTP_USER=your-email@gmail.com
   SMTP_PASSWORD=xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx
   EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=your-email@gmail.com
   ```

4. **Test**:
   - Start application
   - Register new account
   - Check email inbox

**Gmail Limit**: 500 emails/day (fine for MVP)

### SendGrid Option (Better for Production)

1. Sign up: https://sendgrid.com (free 100/day)
2. Create API key
3. Update `.env`:
   ```
   SMTP_HOST=smtp.sendgrid.net
   SMTP_USER=apikey
   SMTP_PASSWORD=SG.your-api-key-here
   ```

## 🆘 Common Questions

### Q: Can I skip CAPTCHA for the initial launch?
**A:** Yes, but add it within first week. You WILL get bot spam without it.

### Q: Do I need to implement everything in the checklist?
**A:** No. Focus on CRITICAL items first. Nice-to-haves can wait.

### Q: What if I find a bug after launch?
**A:** That's normal! Monitor logs, fix quickly, communicate with users.

### Q: How do I rollback if something breaks?
**A:** Keep old version running, or restore from backup. See `PRODUCTION_SETUP.md`.

### Q: Is it safe to launch with these known limitations?
**A:** Yes, if you fix the CRITICAL security issues. Others can be addressed post-launch.

### Q: How much will this cost?
**A:** ~$10/month for MVP, ~$50/month at 1000 users.
