## Development Setup

See [README.md](README.md) for setup instructions.

## Coding Standards

### Backend (.NET)

- Follow [C# Coding Conventions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/coding-conventions)
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations
- Properly handle exceptions
- Add XML comments to public APIs
- Use dependency injection
- Keep controllers thin, logic in services

Example:
```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Creates a new antistic
/// </summary>
/// <param name="request">The antistic creation request</param>
/// <returns>Created antistic details</returns>
[HttpPost]
public async Task<IActionResult> CreateAntistic([FromBody] CreateAntisticRequest request)
{
    // Implementation
}
```

### Frontend (React + TypeScript)

- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow [Airbnb React Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/react)
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Keep components small and focused
- Use meaningful variable/function names
- Add PropTypes or TypeScript interfaces

Example:
```typescript
interface Props {
  antistic: Antistic;
  onLike?: (id: string) => void;
}

const AntisticCard: React.FC<Props> = ({ antistic, onLike }) => {
  // Implementation
};
```

### CSS (Tailwind)

- Use Tailwind utility classes
- Keep custom CSS minimal
- Use responsive design utilities
- Follow mobile-first approach

## Testing

```bash
cd backend
dotnet test
```

Add tests for:
- Controllers
- Services
- Validators
- Complex business logic

### Frontend Tests

```bash
cd frontend
npm run test
```

Add tests for:
- Components
- Utilities
- Hooks
- API calls
