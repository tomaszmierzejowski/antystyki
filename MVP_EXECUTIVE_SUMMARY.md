### ⚠️ Critical Issues (5% - Blocks Production)

1. **Security Vulnerabilities**

## Critical Path to Production

### Must Do (Cannot Launch Without)

1. **Security Hardening** (30 min)
   - Remove hardcoded passwords
   - Generate strong JWT secret
   - Create `.env` files
   - Enable HTTPS enforcement
   - Update CORS configuration
   - Add security headers

2. **Email Configuration** (15 min)
   - Set up Gmail App Password or SendGrid
   - Test email delivery

3. **Server Deployment** (3 hours)
   - Provision server (Kamatera or similar)
   - Configure firewall
   - Deploy Docker containers
   - Set up Nginx + SSL (Let's Encrypt)

4. **Legal Pages** (2 hours)
   - Privacy Policy
   - Terms of Service

**Total Critical Path: ~6 hours**

### Should Do (Recommended Before Launch)

5. **CAPTCHA Protection** (45 min)
   - Prevents bot spam on registration
   - Can be added post-launch if time-critical

6. **Monitoring** (30 min)
   - Health check endpoint
   - Uptime monitoring (UptimeRobot)

7. **Backups** (30 min)
   - Automated daily backups
   - Tested restoration

**Total Recommended: ~8 hours**

### Nice to Have (Can Wait)

- Rate limiting
- Advanced analytics
- Full bilingual (Polish + English)
- Comments system
- User profiles

## Resources Required

### Technical
- **Server**: Ubuntu 22.04, 2GB RAM, 20GB storage (~$5-10/month)
- **Domain**: antystyki.pl (~$15/year)
- **Email**: SendGrid free tier or Gmail (free)
- **SSL**: Let's Encrypt (free)
- **Monitoring**: UptimeRobot free tier (free)

**Total Monthly Cost**: $6-11

### Time
- **Developer Time**: 8-30 hours (depending on launch option)
- **Ongoing Maintenance**: 2-5 hours/week initially

### Team
- Minimum: 1 developer + 1 moderator
- Recommended: 1 developer + 2 moderators

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk (Blocks Launch)
- ⚠️ **Exposed credentials in git** - Fix immediately
- ⚠️ **Weak JWT secret** - Fix immediately
- ⚠️ **Missing HTTPS enforcement** - Fix immediately

### Medium Risk (Degraded Experience)
- ⚠️ **No CAPTCHA** - Bot spam likely
- ⚠️ **No rate limiting** - API abuse possible
- ⚠️ **No monitoring** - Issues undetected

### Low Risk (Acceptable for MVP)
- ℹ️ No analytics - Can add later
- ℹ️ Single language - Can add later
- ℹ️ Basic error messages - Can improve later
